Hi! this will be a short post to help future window manager hackers. Iâ€™m currently developing a window manager and was having trouble debugging it from a TTY (yes, from TTY). After a bit of searching, I find the Xephyr.

## Xephyr - A Nested X Server

Xephyr is the best way to test and run a window manager. It basically runs an X server inside a window.

### Installation (Arch Linux, Void Linux)

```shell
$ sudo pacman -S xorg-server-xephyr
```

```shell
$ sudo xbps-install xorg-server-xephyr
```

### Usage

```shell
$ Xephyr -screen 1280x720 :1
```

Create a nested X server window with size 1280x720 and display name ":1".

#### Launching applications

```shell
$ DISPLAY=:1 dwm
```

> Launch the `dwm` in display ":1".

To launch an application, specify the display followed by the application command.

#### Grabbing and un-grabbing user input

Pressing Ctrl+Shift should lock/unlock your mouse pointer and your keystrokes inside Xephyr window exclusively if possible.

## C - Preprocessors

I could end this post here, but I want to share a useful way for logging in your application using C preprocessors:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define LOG(str) printf("app --> %s\n", str);

int main() {
  int err = 0;

  // ...

  #ifdef LOG
  LOG("<log> main();")
  if (err)
    LOG("<error> main();")
  #endif

  return 1;
}
```

> C preprocessors enable conditional code inclusion based on macro definitions ([Conditional Compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor#Conditional_compilation)).

Tadah! Now you can enable or disable the log system simply by commenting or uncommenting the `#define LOG` line. Of course, you can also apply this strategy using a library like [log.c](https://github.com/rxi/log.c).
