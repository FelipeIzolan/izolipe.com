Hi! Warframe is easily one of my favorite games, and of its 60+ Warframes, Mirage has my heart. So, I'm here to share the best Mirage Build that lets me explode everything in my path and survive in high-level missions.

## Mods & Arcanes

<Image src={Image2} alt='Mirage Prime build mods'/>

Before I explain each part, yes, this build uses shield-gating for survivability. If you don't like needing to cast an ability every time your shields break, I recommend this [shield recharge-based build](https://overframe.gg/build/191180/mirage-prime/total-malevolence-mirage-dual-augment-max-dps-weapon-platform-solo-steel-path/) instead.

### Mods

Basically for Mirage what counts is **strength** and **duration**.

- [Corrosive Projection](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Corrosive_Projection) - Reduces enemy armor, more damage.
- [Primed Sure Footed](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Primed_Sure_Footed) - Resists knockdown, helps using explosive weapons.
- [Blind Rage](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Blind_Rage) - More strength, more damage.
- [Augur Secrets](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Augur_Secrets) - More strength & shield gate.
- [Catalyzing Shields](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Catalyzing_Shields) - Shield gate.
- [Rolling Guard](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Rolling_Guard) - Survivability.
- [Narrow Minded](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Narrow_Minded) - More duration.
- [Umbral Intensify](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Umbral_Intensify) - More strength.
- [Hall of Malevolence](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Hall_of_Malevolence) - More damage.
- [Total Eclipse](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Eclipse) - More damage. (applies to Mirage's clones)

### Arcanes

- [Molt Augmented](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Molt_Augmented) - More strength.
- [Arcane Aegis](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane_Aegis) - Survivability. (12s of Immortality)

### Augur Set 

Instead of Brief Respite, this build uses Augur mods to convert energy into shields, allowing shield-gating. To enhance the bonus and improve the shield-gate effect, you must equip the following mods on a secondary weapon:

- [Augur Pact](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Augur_Pact)
- [Augur Seeker](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Augur_Seeker)

> My recommendation is to use the secondary weapon as a primer.

## Helminth

<Image src={Image3} alt='Helminth Nourish'/>
[Nourish](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Nourish). More damage, viral status, and energy sustain. It also removes the need to build weapons with viral, allowing you to focus on other status like corrosive for armor strip.

## Archon Shards

<Image src={Image4} alt='Archon Shards'/>

The only mandatory Archon Shard is one Amber for casting speed (two if it isnâ€™t Tauforged).

### My recommendation

- 2 Tauforged Azure - +150 Energy Max.
- 2 Tauforged Crimson - +30% Ability Strength.
- 1 Tauforged Amber - +37.5% Casting Speed.

## Survivability Layers

### 1 - Parkour + Clones

Mirage's passive makes acrobatics 50% faster, and combined with her clones (which enemy AI can focus) creates a strong survivability layer for evading enemy attacks.

### 2 - Rolling Guard

Rolling guard provides 3s of invulnerability and remove status. It's used to remove DoT status (slash, electricity, heat, toxin & gas) and as a panic button.  

### 3 - Shield Gate

Ok! As you can see, the main way to survive is through shield gating. Basically, you'll use Nourish or Eclipse to restore your shields.

- Eclipse - 39 energy cost; returns 46 shields; gives 0.67s of Shield Gating.
- Nourish - 78 energy cost; returns 93 shields; gives 1.33s of Shield Gating.

> The calculation was made based on 120% shield convertion from Augur mods.

### 4 - Arcane Aegis

You can't rely on Arcane Aegis to survive, think of it as 12 seconds of relief, a good time to escape or kill an enemy.
