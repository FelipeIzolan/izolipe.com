Data types determine the context of a value, variable, or memory bits.

## Built-in Data Types

### Text Sequence Type (str)
```python
"Hi mom!"
'This world is an illusion, exile!'
```
### Numeric Types (int, float & complex)
```python
1337
3.14
7j
```
### Boolean Type (True & False)
```python
True
False
```
### Sequence Types (list, tuple & range)
```python
["Hi!", 33, True]
("Bye!", 66, False)
range(3, 15, 3)
```

### Mapping Type (dict)
```python
{ 
  "key": "value",
  "num": 1
}
```

### Set Types (set, frozenset)
```python
{ "Dog", "Cat", "Elephant" }
frozenset({})
```

## The 'range' Type 

The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping.

```python
for n in range(10):
  print(n)
```

```python
x = list(range(0, 100, 3))
print(x)
```

## List vs Tuple

The main difference is that a list is mutable (can be changed), while a tuple is immutable (cannot be changed).

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
x.append(4)
print(x) # ok
```

```python
x = (1, 2, 3)
x.append(4) # error
```

---

## Set vs FrozenSet

The main difference is that a set is mutable (can be changed), while a frozenset is immutable (cannot be changed).

```python
x = {1, 2, 3}
x.add(4)
print(x) # ok
```

```python
x = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
x.add(4) # error
```
