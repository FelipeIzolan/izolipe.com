Python allow you to create isolated spaces for different projects, each with their own dependencies.

---

## Creating virtual environments

```shell
$ python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

---

## Activating a virtual environment (Windows, Linux)

```shell
$ <venv>\Scripts\activate
```

```shell
$ source <venv>/bin/activate
```

Now you can install packages in isolated environments using pip. View installed packages with **pip list** or **pip freeze**.

---

## Deactivating a virtual environment

```shell
$ deactivate
```
> This command only works when inside an active virtual environment.
