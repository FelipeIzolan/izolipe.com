Python doesn't use keywords like 'let' or 'var'; it uses a name/value structure for variables.

---

## Assignment

```py
name = "value"
```

A variable is created using the assignment operator (=), with the variable name on the left-side and the value on the right-side.

---

## Mutability

Python variables (or names) store references to values, meaning you can assign/reassign them any value of any type.

```python
x = 22 # <- int
x = (1, True, 'Hi!') # <- tuple
```
