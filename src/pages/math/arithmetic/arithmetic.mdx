Arithmetic is the study of numbers and basic operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication** and **division**.

---

## Addition

Addition is the process of combining two or more values.\
The result of a addition = **"sum"**

> $
1 + 1 = 2\\
8 + 4 = 12\\
-12 + 37 = 25\\
-128 + 371 = 243\\
42.4 + 6.27 = 48.67\\
-21.72 + 10.5 = -11.22
$

---

## Subtraction

Subtraction is the process of compute the difference between two or more values.\
The result of a subtraction = **"difference"**

> $
2 - 2 = 0\\
24 - 6 = 18\\
-7 - 3 = -10\\
-14 - 32 = -46\\
5.325 - 1.125 = 4.2\\
-32.64 - 32.64 = -64.128
$

---

## Multiplication

Multiplication is the process of repeating a sum of the same number.\
The result of a multiplication = **"product"**

> $
10 \times 5 = 50\\
4 \times 8 = 32\\
-12 \times 3 = -36\\
-7 \times -5 = 35
$

---

## Division

Division is the process of distributing a quantity into equal parts or groups.\
The result of a division = **"quotient"**

> $
36 \div 6 = 6\\
55 \div 4 = 13.75\\
-100 \div 8 = -12.5\\
-128 \div -4 = 32
$

## Identity Property

The identity property says that a special number (the identity element) keeps any number unchanged in an operation.

### Additive Identity
$a+0=a$
> The additive identity is $0$.

### Subtractive Identity
$a-0=a$
> The subtractive identity is $0$.

### Multiplicative Identity
$a*1=a$
> The multiplicative identity is $1$.

### Divisive Identity
$a\div1=a$
> The divisive identity is $1$.

## Law of Signs

### Addition & Subtraction

$
(-)(-) = (-)\\
(+)(+) = (+)\\
\LARGE(-)\normalsize (+) = (-)\\
\LARGE(+)\normalsize (-) = (+)
$

### Multiplication & Division

$
(-)(-) = (+)\\
(+)(+) = (+)\\
(-)(+) = (-)\\
(+)(-) = (-)
$
