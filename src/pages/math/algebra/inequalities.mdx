Inequalities are mathematical expressions that compare values using the following symbols:

- **\>**: Greater than
- **\<**: Less than
- **≥**: Greater than or equal to
- **≤**: Less than or equal to

Unlike equations, which express equality, **inequalities show a relationship where one value is not necessarily equal to another**.

## Inverting Inequality Operators
When **multiplying or dividing** both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must **reverse the inequality symbol**:

- **\>** becomes **\<**;
- **≥** becomes **≤**;
- **\<** becomes **\>**;
- **≤** becomes **≥**;

### Example

> $
-2x > 6\\
-2x * -1 > 6 * -1\\
2x < -6
$

## Solving Simple Inequalities

To solve inequalities, it's similar to solving equations.

### Addition Inequality

<Image src={Image2} alt='Inequality of x > 8'/>
   
> $
x + 4 > 12\\
x + 4 - 4 > 12 - 4\\
x > 8
$

### Subtraction Inequality

<Image src={Image3} alt='Inequality of x < 9'/>

> $
x - 7 < 2\\
x - 7 + 7 < 2 + 7\\
x < 9
$

### Multiplication Inequality

<Image src={Image4} alt='Inequality of x >= 4'/>

> $
3x \ge 12\\
\frac{\cancel{3}x}{\cancel{3}} \ge \frac{12}{3}\\
x \ge 4
$

### Division Inequality

<Image src={Image5} alt='Inequality of x <= 6'/>

> $
\frac{x}{2} \le 3\\
2 * \frac{x}{2} \le 3 * 2\\
\cancel{2} * \frac{x}{\cancel{2}} \le 6\\
x \le 6
$
