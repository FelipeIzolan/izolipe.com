The **ratios** are the **relationships between two values**.

## Part-to-Part & Part-to-Whole  
 
A ratio has two types of relationships:

<Image src={Image3} alt='Red and blue squares'/>
  
- **Part-to-Part**: The relationship between one part to another part.
  > **14:10** 14 blue to 10 red.\
  > **10:14** 10 red to 14 blue.
- **Part-to-Whole**: The relationship between one part and the whole, the total.
  > **14:24** 14 blue to 24 total.\
  > **10:24** 10 red to 24 total.

## Equivalent Ratios

<Image src={Image2} alt='Equivalent ratios'/>

**Equivalent Ratios** are ratios that have **the same proportion**, even if the numbers are different.

> **3:1** $\small(3 * 1):(1 * 1)$\
> **6:2** $\small(3 * 2):(1 * 2)$\
> **9:3** $\small(3 * 3):(1 * 3)$

## Scaling Ratios

Ratios represent a proportion that can be increased or decreased.

<Image src={Image4} alt="Ratio 1:2"/>
 
> **1:2** $\small base \div 2$\
> **2:4** $\small base$\
> **4:8** $\small base * 2$

> **4:3** $\small base \div 2$\
> **8:6** $\small base$\
> **12:9** $\small base * 2$
