## Multiples

Multiples of a number are the numbers you get by multiplying that number by integers (positive, negative, or zero).

- **Multiples of 8**:\
  $\{8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, ...\}$
- **Multiples of 3.5**:\
  $\{3.5, 7, 10.5, 14, 17.5, 21, 24.5, 28, 31.5, 35, ...\}$
- **Multiples of -5**:\
  $\{-5, -10, -15, -20, -25, -30, -35, -40, -45, -50, ...\}$

## Factors

Factors are whole numbers that can divide another number evenly, without leaving a remainder.

- **Factors of 16**:\
  $\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16\}$
- **Factors of 35**:\
  $\{1, 5, 7, 35\}$
- **Factors of 52**:\
  $\{1, 2, 4, 13, 26, 52\}$

## Divisibility


Divisibility means a whole number can be divided by another number (the divisor) without leaving a remainder.

**8 is divisibly by 2**\
**8 not is divisibly by 3**

### Divisibility Rule

A divisibility rule is a fast way to determine whether a number is divisible by a divisor or not.\
